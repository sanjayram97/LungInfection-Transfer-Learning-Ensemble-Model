# Lung Infection Prediction using Transfer Learning 
# Ensemble Model Statistics
Lung Infection prediction using different transfer learning techniques like InceptionV3, Resnet, ResnetV2, Vgg16, Vgg19. Bagging model based on the predictions from all these models. Created a wrapper API using flask.

git clone https://github.com/sanjayram97/LungInfection_TransferLearning_EnsembleModel.git

Please download Models from link -> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13qoMihgWNN1wDA2r0-F0ePtqzQ4m-z8w?usp=sharing
and place it in main_models folder

run python app.py in cmd
